    <h1>Welcome to Our Interactive AI Science Fair!</h1>
    <p>Explore amazing science facts about everyday objects with the help of AI. Remember, always verify what the AI tells you!</p>

    <div class="station">
        <h2>Station 1: The Mysterious Toy Car</h2>
        <img src="/api/placeholder/400/300?text=Toy+Car" alt="Toy Car" />
        <p>Click on the toy car to ask the AI about it!</p>
        <div class="interaction">
            <p><strong>You ask:</strong> "Tell me a cool science fact about this toy car!"</p>
            <p class="ai-response"><strong>AI responds:</strong> "This toy car is a great example of Newton's laws of motion. When you push it, that's Newton's First Law in action - an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force!"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact-check">
            <p><strong>Fact Check:</strong> Look up Newton's laws of motion. Can you design an experiment with the toy car to demonstrate these laws?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="station">
        <h2>Station 2: The Leaf Laboratory</h2>
        <img src="/api/placeholder/400/300?text=Leaf" alt="Leaf" />
        <p>Examine the leaf and ask the AI for a surprising fact!</p>
        <div class="interaction">
            <p><strong>You ask:</strong> "What's a wacky science fact about leaves?"</p>
            <p class="ai-response"><strong>AI responds:</strong> "Some plants, like the Sandbox Tree, have leaves that can trigger explosive seed dispersal, launching seeds at speeds up to 150 miles per hour!"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact-check">
            <p><strong>Fact Check:</strong> Research explosive seed dispersal in plants. What other plants have interesting seed dispersal methods?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="station">
        <h2>Station 3: The Water Wonder</h2>
        <img src="/api/placeholder/400/300?text=Glass+of+Water" alt="Glass of Water" />
        <p>Observe the glass of water and ask the AI about its properties!</p>
        <div class="interaction">
            <p><strong>You ask:</strong> "Tell me something surprising about water!"</p>
            <p class="ai-response"><strong>AI responds:</strong> "Water can exist in three states simultaneously - solid, liquid, and gas. This is called the triple point of water and occurs at a specific temperature and pressure!"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact-check">
            <p><strong>Fact Check:</strong> Look up the triple point of water. Under what conditions does this occur? Can you find other substances with interesting phase diagrams?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Create Your Own Experiment!</h2>
    <p>Now it's your turn! Think about combining objects from different stations. What questions would you ask the AI? How would you verify its answers?</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What was your favorite discovery from this virtual science fair?</li>
        <li>How could we use AI to explore other subjects?</li>
        <li>What new experiments would you like to try in real life?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, science is all about asking questions and finding answers. Keep exploring!</p>
